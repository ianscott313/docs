<Note>
  If you're not a white label, this documentation does not apply to you. All API endpoints require an Agency-level API Key
</Note>

## Welcome

There are two ways to manage your users: [the Label Dashboard](https://dashboard.brandblast.ai) and [the API](https://docs.brandblast.ai). In the future we'll expand this API to also manage your brands, but as of today its primary functionality is for managing your users.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using an API key passed in the X-API-Key header. This agency api key can be found in the profile tab of the white label admin's account. 

```json
X-API-Key: your-ageny-api-key
```

<Warning>
  Do not mistake this for the Brand API Key from the Brand Context.
